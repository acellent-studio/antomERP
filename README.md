# antomERP
(Old version) An OWIN web based program created by Acellent IT Studio

I am trying to create a web-based program that could be running on a user's PC or laptop without IIS web server up and running on that computer.
antomERP is the first project for the aforementioned purpose. Since I'm working on a newer version of antomERP, called acellentWeb instead, therefore, if you want to use this program, please refer to https://github.com/acellent-studio/acellentWeb.

Thank you.
